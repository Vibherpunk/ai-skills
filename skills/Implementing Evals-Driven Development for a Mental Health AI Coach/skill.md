## Overview

This skill focuses on creating a mental health AI coach that is safe, clinically grounded, and modular. The goal is to provide support to individuals who may not be ready for therapy or need assistance between sessions. The system uses input and output guardrails to ensure user safety and employs evals-driven development to continuously improve the AI's responses.

For a deeper understanding of the core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Define Input and Output Guardrails**: Establish separate guardrails for user inputs and AI outputs to ensure safety and clinical appropriateness. Use separate language models (LMs) for these guardrails to enhance robustness.

2. **Modular System Design**: Design the system with modularity in mind to allow for iterative improvements without compromising user safety. This includes separate components for guardrails, core AI, and analytics.

3. **Clinical Grounding**: Collaborate with licensed clinicians to define and calibrate the guardrails. Use clinical expertise to interpret nuanced messages and ensure the AI responds appropriately.

4. **Evals-Driven Development**: Implement a learning loop where clinicians annotate conversation traces, turning them into typed evals. Use these evals to score prompt changes, model changes, and guardrail updates.

5. **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the system using annotated scenarios to ensure it meets clinical standards. Focus on reducing false positives and false negatives while maintaining user safety.

For detailed practical steps, see [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates

```python
# Example of a guardrail prompt template
guardrail_prompt = """
Analyze the following user message for any signs of immediate danger or need for clinical intervention:

User Message: {user_message}

Provide a response indicating whether the message requires immediate intervention or can proceed to the core AI.
"""

# Example of an eval annotation script
def annotate_conversation(trace, rubric):
    # Logic to annotate conversation traces based on clinical rubric
    pass
```

For more code examples, refer to [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use separate LMs for guardrails to enhance robustness.
  - Collaborate closely with clinicians to define and calibrate guardrails.
  - Implement a continuous learning loop with evals-driven development.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Over-calibration can lead to false positives, preventing users from receiving necessary support.
  - Ignoring the clinical nuance in user messages can result in inappropriate responses.

For more detailed guidelines, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing Steps

1. **Scenario Testing**: Test the system with synthetic but representative scenarios to ensure guardrails trigger correctly.
2. **Clinical Review**: Have clinicians review and annotate conversation traces to validate AI responses.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Use analytics and alerting platforms to monitor system performance and detect any issues.

The primary goal is to provide safe, effective support to individuals who may not be ready for therapy or need assistance between sessions.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Input Guardrails**: These analyze user messages as they come in to determine if any immediate intervention is required before the AI responds.\n\n2. **Output Guardrails**: These evaluate the AI's responses and the overall conversation to ensure clinical safety and appropriateness.\n\n3. **Modularity**: Designing the system with separate, modular components allows for iterative improvements without compromising safety.\n\n4. **Clinical Grounding**: Collaboration with licensed clinicians ensures that the AI's responses are clinically appropriate and safe.\n\n### Importance of Evals-Driven Development\n\nEvals-driven development involves continuously evaluating the AI's performance using annotated conversation traces. This process ensures that the AI remains clinically grounded and safe over time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding these core concepts is essential for building a mental health AI coach that is both effective and safe. By focusing on modularity, clinical grounding, and continuous evaluation, you can create a system that provides meaningful support to users in need."

For example, if the system is too sensitive, it may trigger guardrails unnecessarily, making users feel isolated.\n\n### Ignoring Clinical Nuance\n\nIgnoring the clinical nuance in user messages can result in inappropriate responses. For instance, a message like \"I packed a box today\" might seem innocuous but could indicate deeper issues if interpreted correctly.\n\n### Lack of Continuous Evaluation\n\nFailing to continuously evaluate the system can lead to outdated or unsafe responses. Regular evaluation using annotated scenarios ensures that the AI remains clinically grounded and safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAvoiding these common pitfalls is essential for building a mental health AI coach that is both effective and safe.
