# Agentic Marketing Teams

> Build AI marketing agents that research pain points, generate ad creative, publish to Facebook Ads, and optimize in a continuous feedback loop — all powered by a unified data warehouse.

## What is a Marketing Agent?

A real marketing agent has **three essential components:**

1. **Unified data** — access to all business data in one place via a data pipeline and warehouse
2. **Autonomous decision-making** — operates on a cadence with a thinking loop, making decisions off live data
3. **Cloud-hosted code** — code running in the cloud, not a linear Zapier workflow

> Most people claiming "autonomous marketing agents" are running simple linear automations. A real agent has a feedback loop, accesses live business data, and makes decisions autonomously.

## Infrastructure Stack

### Data Pipeline & Warehouse

Unify all data sources so the agent understands all channels in context.

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Airbyte** (open source, self-hosted) | Data pipeline with pre-built connectors |
| **ClickHouse** (open source, self-hosted) | Data warehouse |

**Data sources to unify:** Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, PostHog, HubSpot/CRM, Stripe.

### Agent Hosting

Deploy as code in the cloud — Railway, Heroku, or any cloud provider.

### Facebook Marketing API

**Use the API only for:** Publishing content, turning off underperforming ads, promoting winning ads. Do NOT pull bulk data.

## The Complete Agent Workflow

### Step 1: Research Pain Points
Scrape Reddit for real customer complaints. Use Perplexity for quick synthesis. Rank by frequency — most-referenced pain points become ad hooks.

### Step 2: Generate Creative
- **Kai AI** — unified image/video generation
- **Google Nano Banana** — static ad creative
- **HeyGen** — AI avatar UGC video
- **Seedance** — emerging video (~9 sec limit)
- Use a vision model to verify brand compliance

### Step 3: Publish to Facebook Ads
Agent creates ad sets and ads via Marketing API. Example: 2 ad sets/day, 5 ads/ad set.

### Step 4: Monitor & Optimize
2-3 day learning window. Turn off worst performers, keep winners live. Winners pool competes for budget.

### Step 5: Feedback Loop
Build a database of prompts, scripts, and performance data. Agent analyzes what's working and generates more like the best performers.

## Solving the Entropy Problem

Marketing agents get stuck thinking the same way. Two solutions:
1. **Competitor Ad Library** — Pull competitor ads via Facebook Ads Library API
2. **YouTube/Podcast Transcripts** — Mine niche channels for insights

## Key Principles

1. Marketing is continuous, not campaign-based
2. Test 10-15-20 variations of the same ad with different positioning
3. Let the market tell you what works — don't impose ideas, test them
4. Start with a human in the loop, then graduate to full autonomy

## Quick Start

1. Identify product/service and target customer
2. Research customer pain points via Reddit scraping
3. Set up data pipeline (Airbyte → ClickHouse)
4. Connect data sources (Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, Stripe, CRM)
5. Build agent with thinking loop reading from the warehouse
6. Connect to Facebook Marketing API (write-only)
7. Define creative generation pipeline (image + video)
8. Set optimization cadence (2-3 day learning window)
9. Implement entropy prevention
10. Start with 2 ad sets/day, 5 ads/ad set, iterate
