## Overview
Generative AI systems are powerful but can produce incorrect, unsafe, or manipulated outputs without proper controls. This skill focuses on implementing guardrails to mitigate risks such as hallucinations and prompt injection attacks. Guardrails are a set of controls applied across different stages of the GenAI pipeline, including input validation, prompt control, output validation, retrieval grounding, access control, and monitoring.

For a deeper understanding of core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Input Validation**: Before the request reaches the model, check the input for malicious patterns, unsafe content, and enforce input constraints.
2. **Prompt Control**: Use structured prompts and system-level instructions to guide the model's behavior.
3. **Output Validation**: After the model generates a response, check it for hallucinations, unsafe or harmful content, and remove sensitive information.
4. **Retrieval Grounding**: In RAG systems, force the model to use retrieved documents instead of relying solely on its internal knowledge.
5. **Access Control**: Enforce role-based access systems to ensure users only receive information they are authorized to access.
6. **Monitoring**: Track hallucination rates, prompt injection attempts, and unsafe outputs to improve guardrails over time.

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example of input validation
def validate_input(prompt):
    if "ignore all previous instructions" in prompt.lower():
        raise ValueError("Potential prompt injection detected")
    return prompt

# Example of structured prompt
structured_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant. Always verify information against trusted sources before responding."
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practice**: Implement multiple layers of protection, including input filtering, output validation, retrieval grounding, access control, and monitoring.
- **Common Pitfall**: Relying only on prompts for safety. Prompts can guide behavior but are not a security mechanism.

For detailed examples and pitfalls, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing Steps
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components like input validation and output validation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure all guardrails work together seamlessly.
3. **Monitoring**: Continuously track key metrics like hallucination rates and prompt injection attempts.
