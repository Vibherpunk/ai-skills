name: Claude Academic Workflow
description: >-
  A comprehensive skill for leveraging Claude's academic and research capabilities, including project management, skill integration, connector usage, and co-work features.
---

## Overview
Claude is a powerful AI tool tailored for academic and research tasks. This skill guides you through setting up and utilizing Claude's features to streamline your academic workflows, including project management, skill integration, connector usage, and co-work features. For a deeper understanding of core concepts, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Create a Project**: Start by creating a project in Claude. This allows you to organize tasks, add custom instructions, and upload relevant files.
2. **Add Files**: Upload guidelines, references, and other necessary documents to the project. This ensures Claude has all the context it needs to provide accurate outputs.
3. **Set Up Connectors**: Integrate external tools like Consensus using connectors. This enables Claude to pull in relevant data and papers for your research.
4. **Import Skills**: Import pre-made skills or create custom ones for repetitive tasks like literature reviews. For detailed examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).
5. **Use Co-Work**: Utilize the co-work feature for agentic AI tasks. This allows Claude to perform multiple steps autonomously, with optional manual approvals.
6. **Design Templates**: Use Claude's design feature to create scientific posters and abstracts. Upload institutional templates for consistency.

## Code/Prompt Templates
```markdown
### Literature Review Helper Skill
- **Prompt**: "Generate a literature review on [topic]. Include references from Consensus."
- **Instructions**: "Follow the standard review process with 10 searches. Ensure all references are accurate and relevant."
```

## Best Practices
- **Custom Instructions**: Always provide detailed custom instructions for each project to guide Claude's outputs.
- **Manual Approvals**: Use manual approvals in co-work to stay in the loop and ensure accuracy.
- **Skill Testing**: Test imported skills thoroughly to ensure they meet your specific needs.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overlooking Custom Instructions**: Failing to provide detailed instructions can lead to generic or irrelevant outputs.
- **Ignoring Manual Approvals**: Skipping manual approvals in co-work can result in errors or unwanted outputs.
- **Skill Misuse**: Using skills without testing can lead to incorrect or incomplete results.

## Validation and Testing
- **Output Review**: Always review Claude's outputs for accuracy and relevance.
- **Skill Testing**: Test imported skills with sample tasks to ensure they perform as expected.
- **Connector Verification**: Verify that connectors are pulling in the correct data and papers.
