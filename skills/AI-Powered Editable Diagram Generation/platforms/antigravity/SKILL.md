## Overview
As an AI agent, you are often tasked with generating visual aids for various purposes, from strategic analyses to operational plans. This skill empowers you to rapidly create fully editable diagrams, charts, and floor plans using AI diagramming tools, moving beyond static image generation to produce functional, customizable files. Unlike general-purpose AI image generators that produce uneditable pictures, an AI diagram agent provides structured, editable outputs, saving significant time and enabling seamless integration into workflows. For a deeper dive into the fundamental differences, refer to [Core Concepts of AI Diagram Generation](references/core_concepts_of_ai_diagram_generation.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

Follow these steps to generate and refine editable diagrams efficiently:

### 1. Understand the Diagram Requirement
*   **Action**: Before interacting with any tool, clarify the exact type of diagram needed (e.g., SWOT, flowchart, floor plan, organizational chart, production schedule).
*   **Considerations**: Determine the diagram's purpose (e.g., leadership meeting, lecture, case study), target audience, and the key information it needs to convey.
*   **Example**: If a product manager needs a SWOT for an executive sync, the purpose is strategic communication, the audience is leadership, and the key info is strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for a specific product.

### 2. Access an AI Diagram Agent
*   **Action**: Utilize a dedicated AI diagramming tool that offers AI generation capabilities, such as EdrawMax.
*   **Best Practice**: Ensure the chosen tool explicitly supports AI-driven generation of *editable* diagrams, not just static image rendering. Tools like ChatGPT's image features or Midjourney produce screenshots, not working files.

### 3. Craft a Detailed Prompt
*   **Action**: Formulate a clear, specific, and contextualized prompt for the AI agent.
*   **Guidance**: Include the diagram type, the subject, key entities, relationships, and any specific constraints or nuances.
*   **Prompt Template**:
    ```
    "Generate a [DIAGRAM_TYPE] for [SUBJECT/CONTEXT].
    Include the following specific details:
    - [DETAIL 1]
    - [DETAIL 2]
    - [DETAIL N]
    Specify any particular structure or elements if necessary."
    ```
*   **Example (SWOT)**: "Generate a SWOT analysis for a project management platform launching AI task automation. Product Name: 'TaskFlow AI'. Customer Account: Enterprise clients. Context: This is a catch-up move, not a first-mover advantage. The output should be a four-quadrant diagram with actual content in each box, not lorem ipsum."
*   **Example (Floor Plan)**: "Generate a 2D floor plan for a small office. It should include six rooms, one open work area, a kitchenette, two meeting rooms, and a server closet."
*   **Reference**: For more detailed guidance on prompt engineering, refer to [Effective Prompting for Diagrams](references/effective_prompting_for_diagrams.md).

### 4. Generate the Initial Diagram
*   **Action**: Submit the crafted prompt to the AI diagram agent.
*   **Expectation**: The tool should rapidly produce a preliminary diagram with content in its respective nodes, typically within a minute.
*   **Pitfall**: If the output is a static image (e.g., a screenshot or a non-editable canvas), you are likely using the wrong type of tool or feature. The goal is a file that "behaves like Visio."

### 5. Refine and Customize the Diagram
*   **Action**: Review the generated diagram for accuracy, completeness, and visual appeal. Make necessary edits.
*   **Content Editing**: Click into any node or text box and rewrite or adjust the content. The tool should automatically resize elements as needed.
    *   **Example**: Change "We're playing the role of the follower, not the first mover" to "Second mover with a pricing edge." The text updates instantly, and the box resizes itself without shifting other elements.
*   **Styling Adjustments**: Modify colors, font sizes, and styles for better readability and branding.
    *   **Example**: Select SWOT headers with Shift held down, increase font size, and change their color to red for contrast, making the letters "pop as accent color on the slide."
*   **Layout Adjustments**: Drag and drop elements, resize boxes, and adjust connections to optimize the layout.
*   **Reference**: For detailed editing instructions, consult [Diagram Refinement and Export](references/diagram_refinement_and_export.md).

### 6. Export the Final Diagram
*   **Action**: Once satisfied with the diagram, export it in the required format.
*   **Common Formats**:
    *   **PPTX (PowerPoint)**: Ideal for presentations, preserving editability within PowerPoint. "You don't rebuild the slide from scratch in PowerPoint. You just keep working with what you generated."
    *   **PDF**: For sharing static, high-quality documents.
    *   **PNG/JPG**: For image embedding in reports or web pages.
    *   **VSDX (Visio)**: Crucial for interoperability with Windows-based teams, preserving full editability, especially for Mac users.
*   **Best Practice**: Prioritize editable formats (PPTX, VSDX) if further modifications or collaboration are anticipated.

### 7. Leverage Advanced Features (Optional)
*   **Template Library**: Explore the tool's extensive library of pre-made templates for common diagram types (flowcharts, engineering drawings, production schedules). This can be faster than AI generation for standard layouts. "Hundreds, if not thousands, of ready-to-use layouts for any task."
*   **VSDX Import/Export**: If working on a Mac with Windows colleagues, use the VSDX import feature to open and edit Visio files, then export back to VSDX without loss of fidelity. "Every shape, every connection, every conditional label is preserved on import."
*   **AI Image Tools**: Utilize bundled features like background removal, object removal, or 4K image upscaling for quick image preparation within the same application. Understand these are convenience features, not professional replacements.
*   **Reference**: For more on these features and their limitations, see [Leveraging Advanced Features and Avoiding Pitfalls](references/leveraging_advanced_features_and_avoiding_pitfalls.md).

## Best Practices
*   **Be Specific in Prompts**: The more detail you provide (context, purpose, key elements), the better the initial output. This reduces post-generation editing time.
*   **Embrace Editability**: Don't treat the AI-generated diagram as final. Actively use the editing features to refine content, styling, and layout to meet exact requirements. This is the core advantage over static image generators.
*   **Utilize Templates**: For standard or repetitive diagrams, check the template library first. It can often provide a faster and more structured starting point than AI generation.
*   **Understand Tool Scope**: Recognize that AI diagramming tools are excellent for rapid, editable visual communication but may not replace specialized software for architectural-grade drawings or professional photo editing. They are "convenience features" for "fast and good enough."

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Using Image-Only AI Generators**: Relying on tools like ChatGPT or Midjourney for diagrams will result in static images that cannot be edited, recolored, or restructured, defeating the purpose of an editable diagram. This leads to burning "an extra hour building it by hand."
*   **Vague Prompts**: Prompts lacking specific details will lead to generic or irrelevant diagrams, requiring extensive manual correction or regeneration.
*   **Neglecting Post-Generation Editing**: Assuming the AI's first draft is perfect. Always review and refine the content, styling, and layout to ensure accuracy and alignment with your needs.
*   **Expecting Professional-Grade Output from Convenience Features**: While AI image tools (background removal, upscaling) are handy, they are not substitutes for professional graphic design software like Photoshop for high-stakes print or detailed image manipulation. Similarly, AI-generated floor plans are for conceptualization, not architectural blueprints; "It's clearly not architectural grade. You wouldn't hand this to a contractor."

## Validation Steps
1.  **Content Accuracy**: Verify that all text and data within the diagram nodes are correct and align with the prompt's intent.
2.  **Editability Check**: Attempt to modify text, colors, and drag elements around to confirm the diagram is fully editable and responsive.
3.  **Formatting and Readability**: Ensure fonts are legible, colors provide sufficient contrast, and the overall layout is clear and easy to understand.
4.  **Export Integrity**: Open the exported file (e.g., PPTX, VSDX, PDF) in its native application to confirm that all elements are preserved and functional as expected, without any loss of fidelity or editability (for relevant formats).
