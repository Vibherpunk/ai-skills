  A comprehensive skill for integrating Chinese AI models into workflows, including selection, deployment, and testing strategies.

## Overview
Integrating Chinese AI models into your workflow requires a nuanced approach, considering factors like cost, capability, and deployment. This skill guides you through selecting, deploying, and testing Chinese AI models effectively.

## Core Concepts
Understanding the landscape of Chinese AI models is crucial. Models like DeepSeek, Kimi K3, and Qwen offer varying capabilities and costs. For a deeper dive, refer to [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Identify Your Needs**: Determine the tasks you need the model to perform.
2. **Select Models**: Choose models based on task requirements and cost considerations.
3. **Deployment Strategy**: Decide between API, third-party hosting, or self-hosting.
4. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure model performance meets your standards.
5. **Integration**: Integrate the model into your workflow, monitoring for performance and cost.

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example API call to DeepSeek
import requests

response = requests.post('https://api.deepseek.com/v1/completions',
                         headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
                         json={'prompt': 'Translate this text', 'model': 'deepseek-v4'})
print(response.json())
```

## Best Practices
- **Test Extensively**: Always test models with real-world data before full integration.
- **Consider Costs**: Evaluate not just token costs but overall workflow efficiency.
- **Data Security**: Ensure data handling complies with your security requirements.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overgeneralization**: Avoid assuming all Chinese models are the same in capability or cost.
- **Neglecting Testing**: Skipping thorough testing can lead to unexpected performance issues.

## Validation and Testing
Conduct tests with a diverse set of tasks and edge cases to validate model performance. Use metrics like cost per accepted result to evaluate efficiency.
