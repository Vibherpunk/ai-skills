## Overview
Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) with AI agents involves embedding AI deeply into enterprise workflows to understand, re-engineer, and optimize processes. This skill focuses on mapping human workflows, re-engineering processes around AI, and deploying agents on top of existing systems of record. For a deeper dive into core concepts, see [Core Concepts](references/core_concepts.md).

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Map Human Workflows**: Embed with the client to understand current processes, including edge cases and failure modes.
2. **Re-engineer Processes**: Redesign workflows to maximize AI's capabilities while maintaining usability.
3. **Deploy AI Agents**: Integrate agents with existing systems (e.g., Salesforce, SAP) without requiring migration.
4. **Monitor and Optimize**: Continuously monitor agent performance and refine workflows for maximum ROI.

For detailed steps and best practices, refer to [Practical Guide](references/practical_guide.md).

## Code Snippets and Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Mapping a workflow using a dependency graph
from graphlib import TopologicalSorter

tasks = {'A': {'B', 'C'}, 'B': {'D'}, 'C': {'D'}, 'D': set()}
ts = TopologicalSorter(tasks)
print(list(ts.static_order()))
```
For more examples, see [Code Examples](references/code_examples.md).

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
- **Best Practice**: Always involve process leads in workflow mapping to capture real-world nuances.
- **Pitfall**: Avoid slapping AI onto broken processes; re-engineer workflows first.

For a comprehensive list of pitfalls and how to avoid them, see [Common Pitfalls](references/common_pitfalls.md).

## Validation and Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual agent functions in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure agents work seamlessly with existing systems.
3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate workflows with end-users to ensure usability.
